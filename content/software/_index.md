# 🛠️ Professional Grade Automation
In the short-term rental industry, your software is either a **multiplier** or a **bottleneck**. I personally audit these tools based on **API reliability, integration depth, and ROI.**

### 🔍 My "Technical Host" Audit Criteria:
* **Open Connectivity:** Does it play well with others via Webhooks/API?
* **Scalability:** Can it handle 1 to 100 units without manual intervention?
* **Guest Friction:** Does the software make the guest's life easier or harder?
