# 📈 Is Your Tech Stack Costing You Money?

Most hosts have "accidental" tech stacks—a mix of apps that don't talk to each other. Use this checklist to see if you are a **Technical Host** or a **Manual Operator.**

### 1. The "Zero-Touch" Messaging Test
* [ ] Do guests receive check-in instructions automatically without you touching a button?
* [ ] Does your system detect "late checkout" requests and answer them based on your calendar availability?

### 2. The Hardware-Software Bridge
* [ ] Does your Smart Lock generate a *unique* code for every guest automatically?
* [ ] Does that code deactivate exactly at 11:00 AM on checkout day?

### 3. The Yield Intelligence
* [ ] Is your pricing updating at least 4 times a day based on local events and hotel supply?
* [ ] Are you undercutting your own profit by using "Static" weekend pricing?

### 🔍 Your Score:
* **0-2 Checks:** You are a Manual Operator. You are likely losing 10-15 hours a week on "busy work."
* **3-5 Checks:** You are an Emerging Tech Host. Your systems are working, but they aren't "talking" to each other.
* **6+ Checks:** You are a Technical Host. Your business is a scalable asset.
