  <div style="margin-top: 15px; line-height: 1.6;">
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Zero-Touch Messaging:</strong> Do guests receive check-in info, Wi-Fi, and checkout reminders automatically without you touching a button?</li>
      <li><strong>The Hardware-Software Bridge:</strong> Does your Smart Lock generate a unique, time-bound code for every guest synced to their stay dates?</li>
      <li><strong>Real-Time Yield Intelligence:</strong> Is your pricing updating at least 4x daily based on local hotel compression, weather, and events?</li>
      <li><strong>Noise-to-Privacy Shield:</strong> Do you have sensors that automatically text the guest a "friendly reminder" if decibels exceed limits for >10 mins?</li>
      <li><strong>Unified Inbox Management:</strong> Are you managing Airbnb, VRBO, and Direct Bookings in one single "Source of Truth" screen?</li>
      <li><strong>Auto-Pilot Turnovers:</strong> Does your cleaning team receive a calendar invite and a dynamic task list the second a new booking is confirmed?</li>
      <li><strong>The Digital Concierge:</strong> Is your guidebook API-connected to automatically pull the guest’s name and their specific door code into the welcome screen?</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>🔍 Your Technical Score:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>0-2 Checks: The Manual Operator.</strong> You have a high-stress part-time job. You are likely losing 10-15 hours a week on "busy work."</li>
      <li><strong>3-5 Checks: The Emerging Tech Host.</strong> Your systems are working, but they aren’t "talking" to each other. You are still the middle-man.</li>
      <li><strong>6-7 Checks: The Technical Host.</strong> Your business is a scalable, zero-touch asset.</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote style="background: #fff; border-left: 5px solid #000; padding: 10px; margin: 10px 0;">
      <strong>Technical Edge:</strong> If you scored below a 5, your "Tech Leak" is likely costing you more in labor than the software subscriptions themselves.
