  <strong>🔍 Your Technical Score:</strong>
  <ul>
   <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
    <strong>🔴 0-2 Checks: The Manual Operator</strong> — You don’t own a business; you’ve bought yourself a high-stress, 24/7 job. You are at the "Single Point of Failure." If you drop your phone, your business stops. You are losing 15+ hours a week to tasks that cost $0 to automate.
  </li>
  
  <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
    <strong>🟡 3-5 Checks: The Emerging Tech Host</strong> — You have the right tools, but you’re paying a "Complexity Tax." Your apps don't talk to each other, so you’ve become the manual bridge between them. You’re automated, but you aren’t <em>liberated</em> yet.
  </li>
  
  <li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
    <strong>🟢 6-7 Checks: The Technical Host</strong> — You own a scalable asset. Your tech stack is a unified ecosystem that generates revenue while you sleep, travel, or hunt for your next deal. You have successfully replaced yourself with a system.
